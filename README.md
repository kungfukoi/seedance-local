# NewtNode

A local browser app for generating images and Seedance 2.0 videos through API providers while keeping your keys on your machine.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create your local environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Add your local API keys to `.env`:

   ```bash
   FAL_KEY=your_fal_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## One-Click Launch

Double-click `VS_AI.app` in this folder to start the local backend, start the Vite UI, and open NewtNode in a standalone browser window. `VS_AI.command` does the same thing with terminal logs visible. The launcher filenames are kept for compatibility with existing local shortcuts.

## How Routing Works

- No image files: `bytedance/seedance-2.0/text-to-video`
- Start frame, optional end frame: `bytedance/seedance-2.0/image-to-video`
- Reference images without a start frame: `bytedance/seedance-2.0/reference-to-video`
- Fast mode inserts `/fast/` into the same endpoint family.

Generated videos are downloaded into `outputs/`. Uploaded source images are retained in `uploads/`.

## Notes

Fal's Seedance 2.0 schema currently supports `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`, durations from `4` to `15` seconds or `auto`, aspect ratios including `16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, and synchronized audio generation.

## Named References

Reference images can be renamed in the thumbnail strip. Use those handles in your prompt with `@`, such as `@product` or `@talent`. The app translates your names to Fal's required `@Image1`, `@Image2`, etc. tokens before sending the request.
